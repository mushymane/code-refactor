# Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the page to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines. To achieve this, I first made sure that all the links were functional. Second, I edited the HTML so that it had a semantic structure. Lastly, I cleaned up the stylesheet. I felt that the CSS file was the biggest thing to refactor as there was an abundance of repeated code which severely needed refactoring. One of the challenges I had faced was keeping track of the changes I made. When I refreshed the project on the browser and the page looked completely off, I accidentally undid one too many changes in the code editor and lost track of where I was. Luckily it wasn't too much of a hassle because this is a very small project. And of course I included relative comments for both files.

Having the code easily readable is helpful for not just me, but other developers or anyone who takes look. Being able to readily understand the logic of code is imperative for efficient software development. Websites and webpages structured in a way such as this project is not only more accessible, but also have higher rankings within search engines.
